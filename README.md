# DCRM-HTML5-GSAP-inPage-Polite
Template resource for creating DoubleClick Studio HTML5 banners that use GSAP as the animation engine.

A 300x250 template for DoubleClick Studio, polite loading GSAP, CSS and the animation script.

Exit clicks have been set up on the main area of the banner as well as a separate CTA.

I've borrowed loader animations from @lukehaas http://projects.lukehaas.me/css-loaders/

And I'm using a script Jack @ Greensock https://greensock.com/ to load in multiple scripts using the Enabler.loadScript(); function.
